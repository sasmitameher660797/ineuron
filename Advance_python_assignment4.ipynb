    "__iter__: This method allows an object to be iterable, meaning it can be used in a for loop or other iterable contexts. It should return an iterator object that defines the __next__ method. The __next__ method is responsible for returning the next item in the iteration and raising the StopIteration exception when there are no more items to iterate over. By implementing __iter__, you can define the behavior of your object when used in a for loop or when using functions like iter() or next().\n",
    "\n",
    "__next__: This method is used in conjunction with __iter__ to define the behavior of retrieving the next item in the iteration. It is responsible for returning the next item and advancing the iteration state. By implementing __next__, you can define the specific logic for obtaining the next item in the iteration.\n",
